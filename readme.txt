Hele_Commands.py is the main file
Run Hele_Commands.py to connect to discord

This Application is intended to run on Linux OS, soundbites will not work on Windows
pip3 install dependency_list when running on a new device.

Main features of app:

user mentions with photo:
basically this takes a personal user photo or group of user photos and imposes them on a random backdrop photo as well
as @mentioning them. for example: "hey look so and so is at disneyland ha ha".
    Discord commands:
    *assemble
    *wheres


Destiny_connect:
spits out destiny stats to either a google sheet or excel file
comp is probably what I'm most proud of. The base excel file glory_base.xlsx tries to predict how high your glory can get
based on your win ratio and how many games you expect to play in a week. this was done when glory gains were more
consistent.
    Discord commands:
    *Comp
    *banner
    *trials
    *fight
    *D2register

Calendar:
definitely a work in progress
causes the bot to crash a fair bit, but it works when it works.
best use for this is for the bot to show a countdown timer in its status for the next member birthday or destiny season
    Discord commands:
    *timer
    *timeto
    *showcal
    *addevent
    *delevent
